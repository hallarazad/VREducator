# VREducator
VR Educator is a VR learning application through which its users can learn difficult concepts in VR. It is a general application. I worked on VR Educator for CPU. In this application, the users would travel inside a CPU in VR and explore its operations live to understand it clearly. For example, the lesson I worked on is: “What Happens Inside a Computer When a Key is Pressed?”

•	It has localized voice instructions i.e. in Sindhi, Urdu and English
•	User can switch to any voice language at any time during the gameplay
•	It uses VR Bluetooth controller for movement and selections in game
•	Created resource folders for each language voices and loaded them on runtime whenever user switched to any language.
